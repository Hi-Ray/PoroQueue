# PoroQueue
Load up poros without changing your summoner icon.

## What is it?

Ever had that issue where you load into ARAM, URF or Nexus Blitz and thought; "Oh dang, I've forgotten to equip my poro!"? Well no longer, because this application will make sure that don't have to forget anymore. You load up this app, set it to startup with Windows and let it run in the background. Set your own poro icons and they will all load up and unload automatically.

## How do I get/use it?

You simply go to [Releases](https://github.com/Querijn/PoroQueue/releases) and download the latest version. Place it somewhere you won't easily delete it by accident, and run it. When you are logged into League, it will automatically display your icons if you have any, and show the default icon it will switch back to afterwards. Queue up for any of the supported gamemodes, and your icon will automatically change! 

You can close the window, as long as the application remains running in the background.
